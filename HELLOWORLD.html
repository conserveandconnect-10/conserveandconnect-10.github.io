            <welc1>Conserve and Connect is a student-made project. This means that everything here was researched and coded by, well, students. As of right now, the Conserve and Connect project is limited to this website, but is set to expand at a later date.</welc1>
            <welc2>Future plans include availability in other languages, social media accounds, and possibly even a mobile app, as well as a more easily accessable website. However, this project is run by just one person, who unfortunantely doesn't know much about coding or creating content. In all honesty, although I hope for this project to someday get bigger, it's not possible without help. Again, in the future, the hope it to grow bigger. It's not for popularity or fame, it's simply to inform and educade, so we can begin to move towards a stable future, together.</welc2>

            <sust><b>What is Sustainability?</b></sust>
            <sust1>The definition of sustainability, as stated by Oxford Languages, is as follows: "The ability to be maintained at a certain rate or level" or "Avoidance of the depletion of natural resources in order to maintain an ecological balance". In other words, sustainability is the act of being mindful in terms of the environmental impacts of your daily actions. By being sustainable, one will be able to lower their carbon footprint, reduce their waste output, and live an overall healthier life for them and the world around them.</sust1>
            <sust2>Being sustainable is an enormous part of keeping local and global environments safe, and is a relatively simple practice. While popular, widespread media may present sustainable life to be an intimidating, difficult task, it can be as simple as flipping a switch. Things as simple as turning off the lights when you leave a room, or spending extra time outside can greatly reduce your impact on things like climate change, and even lead you to a happier life.</sust2>
            <sust3>According to several studies around a wide variety of backgrounds and situations, sustainability does actually make people happier. According to these studies, people living more sustainable lives are more successful in their educations and careers, and even have improved mental health. They also spend less money overall, whether it's on water or electricity bills, food, or other things, sustainable life actually helps people save money and resources. These aren't the only perks of sustainable life; other benefits include other health benefits like a strengthened immune system, improved working skills sich as a lengthened attention span, and is even shown to strengthen relationships between friends and family.</sust3>

            <why><b>Why be Sustainable?</b></why>
            <why1>Although it doesn't always seem like it, the Earth is a place with limited resources. It needs time to recover what it looses, and is quickly becoming unable to support humanity. When new cities and towns are built, or forests are cleared for lumber, it's important to keep in mind the fact that it's not possible for more materials to appear instantly. Because of this, many areas are struggling with resource depletion or extreme shortages.</why1>
            <why2>The rapid expantion of society also speeds up other issues, mainly climate change and pollution. These directly lead to the loss of biodiversity in more urban settings, whech then causes inbalances within the local ecosystems. This only takes the whole issue further, causing dramatic growth or decay in terms of species populations, which often leads to infestations. While it isn't possible to reverse the existing effects, we still have time to slow, if not stop, these growing obstacles. </why2>
            <why3>As of right now, it doesn't seem like much is being done by those in power, especially compared to the amount of funding and manpower that they have control over. Because of this, living a more sustainable, environmentally friendly life can help solve local problems like litter or the lack of food for certian animals. With just a few simple actions, which are easy to implement in daily life, the idea of a healthier life will likely become more popular, or at least more well-known.</why3>
